			wardell stephen curry ii, or more just steph curry, is an american professional basketball player for the golden state warriors of the national basketball association (nba). born on march 14, 1988 in the state of ohio, he currently stands 6 and a quarter feet tall, average for a point guard. he is often described as the greatest shooter in nba history by many analysts and players alike. he is also acquainted with revolutionising the modern playstyle of professional basketball to regularly utilise the three-point shot.
			<br><br>
			from a seven-time nba all-star (2014 - 2019, 2021) to a two-time nba most valuable player (mvp) (2015, 2016), curry has won three nba championships with the warriors in 2015, 2017, and 2018. he has also represented the united states in the fiba world cup twice in 2010 and 2014 who went on to rake a gold medal both times.
			<br><br>
			for over a decade, curry has soared the ranks and amassed an outstanding reputation among many other top-level players as well as millions of fans. he has also participated in many charitable events in the past such as in 2012, where curry started donating three insecticide-treated mosquito nets for every three-pointer he made to the united nations foundation's nothing but nets campaign to combat malaria. in 2015, curry wore sneakers that had deah shaddy barakat's name on them, one of the three victims of the 2015 chapel hill shooting. according to his sister suzanne, deah was known for his "love for basketball and anything steph curry". in 2015, after winning the mvp award following his impressive season, curry donated his prize vehicle, a 2016 kia sorento, to the east oakland youth development center, a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of oracle arena, california.

			what i find most admirable about curry is his down-to-earth behaviour both on the court and off the court. when watching matches, i find curry to be "the most human of superstars" with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success. i also find his fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly, as well as casual or committed fans that enjoy his playstyle. besides that, his flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans.
